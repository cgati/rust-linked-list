Linked List Implementation in Rust

This will be an attempt at creating methods for
use on linked lists in rust as a learning exercise.

I found Sean Chenâ€™s example on a toy problem of his
with implementing single-linked lists in rust and have
used that as a starting point for trying out the rust
language.
